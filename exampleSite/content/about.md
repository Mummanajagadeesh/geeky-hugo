Hey, I'm Jagadeesh Mummana. I love all things robotics and AI, from the tiniest microcontroller to building systems that bring ideas to life. As a sophomore at NIT Calicut, studying Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Robotics and Automation, I’m constantly exploring the boundaries of what technology can do.

This blog is where I share what I’ve learned, the challenges I’ve faced, and the projects I’m working on. Whether it’s breaking down a tricky concept, documenting a hands-on build, or just talking about something cool in tech, my goal is to make it relatable and useful.

I believe the best way to grow is by sharing what you know. So, stick around—there’s always something new to learn here!
