#### Puzzles: More Than Just Fun

Puzzles. Whether it’s a crossword, Sudoku, or that infuriating jigsaw piece that just won’t fit, puzzles have a unique way of grabbing our attention and holding it hostage. But have you ever wondered why solving puzzles feels so satisfying? Beyond the fun, puzzles sharpen your mind, boost your problem-solving skills, and, let’s be honest, give you bragging rights.

At their core, puzzles are challenges—a structured way to ask, “How do I figure this out?” And that question is more important than you might think. Life, in many ways, is a giant puzzle: decisions, strategies, unexpected twists. The better we get at solving little puzzles, the more equipped we are for the big ones.

#### Why Solve Puzzles?

Solving puzzles is like a gym session for your brain. They improve cognitive functions, boost memory, and enhance focus. But beyond brainpower, puzzles teach patience, perseverance, and the art of thinking outside the box—skills that are valuable in any field, from coding to cooking to simply navigating life.

And let’s not forget the dopamine rush! Every solved puzzle is a small victory, and our brains love rewarding us for it. Who doesn’t like a mental high five?

#### Coding: The Ultimate Mental Puzzle

Now, let’s talk about coding—arguably one of the most satisfying puzzles you can tackle. Writing code is essentially solving a problem using logic, creativity, and a touch of wizardry. Each bug is a mini-puzzle, each feature a challenge to implement. And with coding puzzles, you’re not just solving; you’re building.

For those who’ve wrestled with algorithms, debugging, or optimizing code, you’ll agree: coding is a puzzle that never gets old. The beauty lies in its versatility. Problems evolve, solutions change, and the learning never stops.

#### Two Hands, One Brain: The Magic of Physical Puzzles

Now, let’s take this a step further: puzzles that involve not just your mind but your hands too. Think about the Rubik’s Cube, where both hemispheres of your brain are engaged. The left brain loves the logical sequences and patterns, while the right brain enjoys the spatial awareness and creativity. It’s like a full-brain workout.

Physical puzzles improve hand-eye coordination, dexterity, and your ability to multitask. Plus, there’s something incredibly satisfying about manipulating an object and watching it transform under your hands. For me, working with physical puzzles has always been a humbling experience—you can’t brute force them; they demand focus and finesse.

#### The Rubik’s Cube: A Personal Journey

Ah, the Rubik’s Cube—a classic that’s equal parts intriguing and intimidating. My first encounter with it was… chaotic, to say the least. Scrambling it was easy, but solving it? Let’s just say it took me more than a few attempts (and some YouTube tutorials) to get it right.

But once I did, it was magical. Solving a Rubik’s Cube is a dance of logic and intuition. It teaches you to think in layers, anticipate moves, and stay calm under pressure. And honestly, it’s just plain cool to whip one out and solve it in front of friends.

#### Puzzles Meet Tech: The Rubik’s Cube Solver

Now imagine combining the worlds of physical and digital puzzles. That’s exactly what we’ll be doing in the **Rubik’s Cube Solver** series. This project is a blend of hardware and software challenges—a perfect playground for anyone who loves puzzles.

The idea is to build a system that can solve a Rubik’s Cube autonomously. From understanding the cube’s mechanics to writing algorithms that optimize solutions, this project is as rewarding as it is complex. And here’s the best part: you’ll get to learn and build alongside me.

*Note*: This project is still in its simulation phase. There are optimizations to be made, and the hardware implementation is yet to be completed. But that’s the beauty of this series—we’ll question every step, learn from every mistake, and inch closer to the solution together.

#### Introducing the PID Series

The Rubik’s Cube Solver is just the beginning. The **PID: Project IN Detail** series is a deep dive into my projects, where I share insights, challenges, and breakthroughs. There’s a lot more to come, and I’m thrilled to have you along for the ride.

In the next few posts, we’ll start with the basics of solving a Rubik’s Cube—the foundational techniques that will help you tackle the puzzle manually. From there, we’ll explore how computers can do it better, faster, and with optimizations we can only dream of.
