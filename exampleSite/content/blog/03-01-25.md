##### Welcome to My Blog! 🚀  

Hey there! 👋 I’m **Jagadeesh Mummana**, and this is my little corner of the internet where I’ll be sharing all things robotics, AI, and the random tech experiments I get into.  

If you’re into building cool stuff, tinkering with microcontrollers, or just figuring out how things work, you’re in the right place. I’ve been into this world of electronics and automation for a while now, and I thought it was about time I started documenting the chaos.  

---

##### Why Start a Blog?  

Honestly? Because I realized I’ve been building all these projects, learning so much along the way, but barely writing any of it down. Most of my work is scattered across random folders on my laptop, and that’s not helping anyone—not even me.  

So, this blog is my way of organizing my thoughts, sharing what I know, and hopefully connecting with people who are just as passionate about tech as I am. Plus, I figured committing to a weekly blog post (every **Friday**, to keep myself accountable) might force me to stay consistent.  

> **My motto?** "Knowledge grows best when shared."

##### Who Am I?  

I’m currently a sophomore at **NIT Calicut**, studying **Electronics and Communication Engineering**, with a minor in **Robotics and Automation**.  

If I had to describe myself, I’d say I’m someone who loves building things, breaking things (not always on purpose!), and figuring out how stuff works. My favorite projects are the ones where software meets hardware—it’s where the real magic happens.  

Oh, and quick confession: I’m *that guy* who always has a million unfinished projects because I keep jumping to the next shiny idea. Maybe this blog will help me finish more of them. Fingers crossed. 

And yeah, like every robotics enthusiast, I’ve had my fair share of sparks and fried circuits along the way. (RIP to my first Arduino board—I barely knew you.

##### What Am I Up To? 🔍  

Here are a few things I’ve been working on:

1. **[PR057H371C4RM](https://github.com/Mummanajagadeesh/PR057H371C4RM)** – *Prosthetic Arm*  
   It’s a prosthetic arm that tries to mimic finger movements. Basically, it uses servos to pull strings (kind of like how tendons work in real life).

2. **[V-RU81K5CU83](https://github.com/Mummanajagadeesh/V-RU81K5CU83)** (*part of [RU83C](https://github.com/Mummanajagadeesh/RU83C)*) – *Virtual Rubik's Cube Simulator*  
   A 3D Rubik’s Cube simulator I built in Unity. It uses the Kociemba Solver to spit out solutions for whatever cube state you throw at it.

3. **[ImProVe](https://github.com/Mummanajagadeesh/ImProVe)** – *Image Processing Using Verilog*  
   This one’s about using Verilog for basic image processing—stuff like edge detection and geometric transformations. It’s been a fun mix of hardware and software. Here are a couple of spin-offs from this project:

{{< image src="images/post/hw/label-detec.png" caption="Label Detection Using Prewitt Operator" alt="alter-text" height="" width="400" position="center">}}


   - **Label Detection**:  
     Using Prewitt and Canny edge detectors to find label boundaries. The idea is to detect sudden intensity changes and slap a bounding box over them. Python helps put it all together in the end.  

   - **Document Scanner** (*In Progress*):  
     Building off the label detection thing, this one’s about finding the four corners of a document and mapping it to a rectangle. Eventually, I want to throw OCR into the mix to extract text too.

##### What’s Next?  

Moving forward, I’ll be diving deeper into these projects and breaking them down into tutorials, lessons, and maybe even some “what not to do” moments (because let’s be real, I’ve had my fair share of mistakes).  

If you’ve got an idea for something I should write about, let me know! I’m always up for exploring new ideas and experiments.
