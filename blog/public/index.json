Whether it’s a crossword, Sudoku, or that infuriating jigsaw piece that just won’t fit, puzzles have a unique way of grabbing our attention and holding it hostage. But have you ever wondered why solving puzzles feels so satisfying? Beyond the fun, puzzles sharpen your mind, boost your problem-solving skills, and, let’s be honest, give you bragging rights.\nAt their core, puzzles are challenges—a structured way to ask, “How do I figure this out?” And that question is more important than you might think. Life, in many ways, is a giant puzzle: decisions, strategies, unexpected twists. The better we get at solving little puzzles, the more equipped we are for the big ones.\nWhy Solve Puzzles? Solving puzzles is like a gym session for your brain. They improve cognitive functions, boost memory, and enhance focus. But beyond brainpower, puzzles teach patience, perseverance, and the art of thinking outside the box—skills that are valuable in any field, from coding to cooking to simply navigating life.\nAnd let’s not forget the dopamine rush! Every solved puzzle is a small victory, and our brains love rewarding us for it. Who doesn’t like a mental high five?\nCoding: The Ultimate Mental Puzzle Now, let’s talk about coding—arguably one of the most satisfying puzzles you can tackle. Writing code is essentially solving a problem using logic, creativity, and a touch of wizardry. Each bug is a mini-puzzle, each feature a challenge to implement. And with coding puzzles, you’re not just solving; you’re building.\nFor those who’ve wrestled with algorithms, debugging, or optimizing code, you’ll agree: coding is a puzzle that never gets old. The beauty lies in its versatility. Problems evolve, solutions change, and the learning never stops.\nTwo Hands, One Brain: The Magic of Physical Puzzles Now, let’s take this a step further: puzzles that involve not just your mind but your hands too. Think about the Rubik’s Cube, where both hemispheres of your brain are engaged. The left brain loves the logical sequences and patterns, while the right brain enjoys the spatial awareness and creativity. It’s like a full-brain workout.\nPhysical puzzles improve hand-eye coordination, dexterity, and your ability to multitask. Plus, there’s something incredibly satisfying about manipulating an object and watching it transform under your hands. For me, working with physical puzzles has always been a humbling experience—you can’t brute force them; they demand focus and finesse.\nThe Rubik’s Cube: A Personal Journey Ah, the Rubik’s Cube—a classic that’s equal parts intriguing and intimidating. My first encounter with it was… chaotic, to say the least. Scrambling it was easy, but solving it? Let’s just say it took me more than a few attempts (and some YouTube tutorials) to get it right.\nBut once I did, it was magical. Solving a Rubik’s Cube is a dance of logic and intuition. It teaches you to think in layers, anticipate moves, and stay calm under pressure. And honestly, it’s just plain cool to whip one out and solve it in front of friends.\nPuzzles Meet Tech: The Rubik’s Cube Solver Now imagine combining the worlds of physical and digital puzzles. That’s exactly what we’ll be doing in the Rubik’s Cube Solver series. This project is a blend of hardware and software challenges—a perfect playground for anyone who loves puzzles.\nThe idea is to build a system that can solve a Rubik’s Cube autonomously. From understanding the cube’s mechanics to writing algorithms that optimize solutions, this project is as rewarding as it is complex. And here’s the best part: you’ll get to learn and build alongside me.\nNote: This project is still in its simulation phase. There are optimizations to be made, and the hardware implementation is yet to be completed. But that’s the beauty of this series—we’ll question every step, learn from every mistake, and inch closer to the solution together.\nIntroducing the PID Series The Rubik’s Cube Solver is just the beginning. The PID: Project IN Detail series is a deep dive into my projects, where I share insights, challenges, and breakthroughs. There’s a lot more to come, and I’m thrilled to have you along for the ride.\nIn the next few posts, we’ll start with the basics of solving a Rubik’s Cube—the foundational techniques that will help you tackle the puzzle manually. From there, we’ll explore how computers can do it better, faster, and with optimizations we can only dream of.\nWhy Wait? Let’s Get Started! Puzzles are more than a pastime; they’re a way of thinking, learning, and growing. Whether you’re a coding enthusiast, a Rubik’s Cube aficionado, or just someone who loves a good challenge, this series has something for you.\nSo grab a cube, roll up your sleeves, and let’s dive into the fascinating world of puzzles—one twist at a time.\n","date":"January 24, 2025","image":"/blog/images/post/puzzles/puzzles_hu16412763637766407020.jpg","permalink":"/blog/blog/24-01-25/","title":"Why Should You Start Solving Puzzles? #PID1.0"},{"categories":["personal","experience"],"contents":"Last year, I missed ROSCon India due to exams and, honestly, had no idea what I was missing out on.

(And How to Get Started)"},{"categories":["personal"],"contents":"\rHey there! 👋 I’m Jagadeesh Mummana, and this is my little corner of the internet where I’ll be sharing all things robotics, AI, and the random tech experiments I get into.\nIf you’re into building cool stuff, tinkering with microcontrollers, or just figuring out how things work, you’re in the right place. I’ve been into this world of electronics and automation for a while now, and I thought it was about time I started documenting the chaos.\nWhy Start a Blog? Honestly? Because I realized I’ve been building all these projects, learning so much along the way, but barely writing any of it down. Most of my work is scattered across random folders on my laptop, and that’s not helping anyone—not even me.\nSo, this blog is my way of organizing my thoughts, sharing what I know, and hopefully connecting with people who are just as passionate about tech as I am. Plus, I figured committing to a weekly blog post (every Friday, to keep myself accountable) might force me to stay consistent.\nMy motto? \u0026ldquo;Knowledge grows best when shared.\u0026rdquo;\nWho Am I? I’m currently a sophomore at NIT Calicut, studying Electronics and Communication Engineering, with a minor in Robotics and Automation.\nIf I had to describe myself, I’d say I’m someone who loves building things, breaking things (not always on purpose!), and figuring out how stuff works. My favorite projects are the ones where software meets hardware—it’s where the real magic happens.\nOh, and quick confession: I’m that guy who always has a million unfinished projects because I keep jumping to the next shiny idea. Maybe this blog will help me finish more of them. Fingers crossed.\nAnd yeah, like every robotics enthusiast, I’ve had my fair share of sparks and fried circuits along the way. (RIP to my first Arduino board—I barely knew you.\nWhat Am I Up To? 🔍 Here are a few things I’ve been working on:\nPR057H371C4RM – Prosthetic Arm\nIt’s a prosthetic arm that tries to mimic finger movements. Basically, it uses servos to pull strings (kind of like how tendons work in real life). Prosthetic Arm Prototype\rV-RU81K5CU83 (part of RU83C) – Virtual Rubik\u0026rsquo;s Cube Simulator\nA 3D Rubik’s Cube simulator I built in Unity. It uses the Kociemba Solver to spit out solutions for whatever cube state you throw at it. Virtual Rubik\u0026rsquo;s Cube Simulator\rImProVe – Image Processing Using Verilog\nThis one’s about using Verilog for basic image processing—stuff like edge detection and geometric transformations. It’s been a fun mix of hardware and software. Here are a couple of spin-offs from this project: Label Detection Using Prewitt Operator\rLabel Detection:\nUsing Prewitt and Canny edge detectors to find label boundaries. The idea is to detect sudden intensity changes and slap a bounding box over them. Python helps put it all together in the end.\nDocument Scanner (In Progress):\nBuilding off the label detection thing, this one’s about finding the four corners of a document and mapping it to a rectangle. Eventually, I want to throw OCR into the mix to extract text too.\nHeads-up: Due to some constraints, some repositories are currently private. If you’re curious about any of them, feel free to reach out—I’d be happy to share what I can!\nWhat’s Next? Moving forward, I’ll be diving deeper into these projects and breaking them down into tutorials, lessons, and maybe even some “what not to do” moments (because let’s be real, I’ve had my fair share of mistakes).\nIf you’ve got an idea for something I should write about, let me know! I’m always up for exploring new ideas and experiments. LinkedIn\nLet’s Collaborate 🤝 If anything here caught your eye, or if you’ve got a project in mind you’d like to team up on, hit me up.
