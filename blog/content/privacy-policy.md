### Privacy Policy: For Those Who Read These Things  
At Quantum Waffle Enterprises™, we take your privacy as seriously as a developer takes dark mode—meaning it’s non-negotiable. If you're worried about your data, fear not: it’s encrypted, hashed, salted, and probably sprinkled with fairy dust because we believe in *extra*.  

#### The Geeky Fine Print:  
- **Cookies**: No, not the chocolate chip kind (unfortunately). Our cookies are like NPCs: they track your movements, but they promise not to be creepy about it.  
- **Data**: Yes, we collect some. No, we don’t sell it—because we respect your data like a mint-condition holographic Charizard.  
- **Hackers**: If a hacker ever breaks into our system, we’ll encrypt them *and* Rickroll them.

#### More Privacy Policy: You’re Still Reading? Wow, Respect!  
- **Lorem Ipsum**: We don’t actually use “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet” because even *we* know it’s old-school. Instead, we prefer "sudo ipsum," which is way cooler.  
- **Your Data's Vacation Home**: If data were a file, we’d keep it in `/var/secure/fandom/`. Don’t try to `cd` there; it’s locked tighter than the Death Star plans.

#### TL;DR:  
We’re geeks, not villains. We’re here to make the internet a safer, funnier, and infinitely weirder place. Also, we totally don’t read your DMs. Scouts honor. (Unless it’s about quantum pizza delivery—then we *might* peek.) 🍕
